Differernce between JVM, JRE and JDK-
JVM-Java Virtual Machine
JRE-Java Runtime Environment.
JDK-Java Development Kit.

JVM(Java Virtual Machine): It is abstract machine, it is a software which is already provided by the platforms.
                           It provides the runtime environment, where a Source code is get written and that source code is compiled into a byte code.
                           
JRE(Java Runtime Environment):It is runtime environment.
                              It is set of liberies required by JVM in order to execute the code.
                             
JDK(Java Development Kit): It is Development Kit required by the java develpers which is consist of various APIS for you, through which you can write your code.
                         : It contains various packages Eg-java.io,java.util all this API'S are the set of liberies.
                         : JDK also contains  varios tools also availale
                           For ex-Java and Javac
                             Javac is a tool which is used for comailation  of byte code
                             Java- Is used for execution of your byte code.
